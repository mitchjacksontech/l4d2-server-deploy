# Left4Dead2 Dedicated Server on centos7

Refactoring an old [linode stackscript](https://cloud.linode.com/stackscripts/39186)
for spawning a l4d2 server

The stackscript offered whiz-bang live configuration.  This script is
just going to hard code precisely what I want when I play

Work in progress
